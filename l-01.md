# Introduction to Binary Trees

📀 [L1. Introduction to Trees | Types of Trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ANrF3FJm7I&list=PLgUwDviBIf0q8Hkd7bK2Bpryj2xVJk8Vk&index=2)

- As of now we knew arrays, stack, queue, linked lists all these were Linear Data Structures.
- Trees are hierarchical data structures (Non-Linear) that are used to represent a collection of data.
  - Example : Folder Structure (Tree structure with folder as nodes and files as leaves)
- Binary Tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children.
- In Binary Tree, each node can have at max two children (guys 🤦‍♂️).

## Terminology

- Root: The topmost node in the tree.
  > If the root has couple of guys, these guys are called children 🐣 of the root.
- Children : The nodes that are directly connected to the root.
  > If the root has no children, then it is called a leaf node.
- Leaf Node : A node with no children.
- Sub Tree : A subtree is a tree that is a part of another tree.
  > Lets take a node in the tree, now the tree beneath that node is a subtree (with all the guys beneath it 🤦‍♂️).
- Ancestor : A node that is an ancestor of a node in the tree.

  > All the parents (all of em' grand-grand-grand pro max) of the node in consideration are called ancestors.

## Types of Binary Trees

- 1. Full Binary Tree
     > A binary tree is full if every node has 0 or 2 children.
